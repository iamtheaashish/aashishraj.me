                        Again Operating Systems is a fundamental topic for any tech professional.
                        I did complete the playlist on OS by Gate Smashers on YouTube last year,
                        but I wanted to read a book on it to get a deeper understanding.

                        Most inspiring character for me was Lou Gehrig, a baseball player who died young.
                        But whatever time he was alive, he was a model of discipline and dedication.
                        Also learnt a lot from American Presidents like Theodore Roosevelt, Dwight D. Eisenhower
                        and John F. Kennedy. JFK was truly an interesting character. 
                        Tharki bhi tha aur disciplined bhi (Cuban missile crisis).

                        Helped me understand the fundamentals of networking.
                        Now I can imagine how data flows through the internet.
                        It is the foundation on which I will build my knowledge of distributed systems.

                        Technology could enable more precise governance and smart collective choice.
                        This article comes from a competent engineer and not just a political theorist.
                        Implementing this model has challenges for me. My knowledge with blockchain is limited.
                        Mrinal told me to get started with Bitcoin paper. I read it.
