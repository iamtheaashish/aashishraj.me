                <h2>Who I Am</h2>
                <p class="description">
My name is Aashish Raj. I am a freelance backend & DevOps engineer who lives inside the cancerous heart of India, New Delhi (I love my city, not its rulers).
I am currently doing a Bachelor in Computer Application (BCA) from IGNOU, and I am expected to graduate in mid-2028.

<br> <br>

I would have done B.Tech CSE, but sadly my academic path isn't clean.
I had biology in 12th grade because my parents forced me into it. They wanted me to become a doctor.

<br> <br>

Because I didn't have math (even though I got 93 marks in 10th board), my physics deteriorated, 
I lost faith in myself, and I got a compartment in 11th in physics and biology. However, I passed in the second attempt.

<br> <br>

At this point I was really frustrated and depressed. But then my parents said, "12vi krle fir jo krna hoga kr lio"
They even tried forcing me into a GOBERMINT job (which I absolutely hate), but I kept resisting. And here I am.

<br> <br>
Finally, now let me talk about my background with technology. I was in 4th grade when I started insisting on getting a computer.
Because I was using a computer in my school, I was really fascinated by the Windows command prompt.
I used to learn CMD tricks from YouTube videos, write them on paper, and go to my school computer and try them out.
Once I was caught by a lab instructor trying to change the admin's password using cmd. IDGAF.
I was also introduced to programming at this time in school. It was QB64, a modern version of QBasic.
I was also watching biographical videos of famous tech founders.

<br> <br>
Finally, after so much crying and so many tantrums, my father bought me a computer when I was in 5th grade.
It was an i3 4160, with 2GB RAM, a 240GB HDD, and a shiny Dell monitor. I was happy but didn't have Wi-Fi to install applications then.
In 2019, when I was in 7th grade, I won Design Championship 2019 with my schoolmates Aaryan and Rachit, and I was the team leader. Aaryan was competent, but Rachit wasn't.
It was my first big victory. Also, I used to play GTA 3, GTA Vice City, and older versions of MotoGP.

<br> <br>
It was in 8th grade, and the year was 2020, when lockdown started because of COVID-19. Classes shifted online, and my school did it on 
Microsoft Teams (heavy and bloated). My potato computer started hanging a lot; RAM usage was 99% when using Teams. I couldn't use anything else during my online classes.
So I asked my father to buy me an extra stick of 2 GB RAM. I got it, but when I went to system properties, it showed something like "3.9 GB but 2 GB usable."
It was because my Windows was 32-bit, and it couldn't utilize the full 4GB RAM.

<br> <br>
I knew about Linux by then, but hadn't tried it yet. My first option was to upgrade to 64-bit Windows, but that would have cost me extra money, and 
I didn't have wifi to install the 64-bit version and additional device drivers. I just had two phones in my home with Jio SIMs.
And Jio was giving 1.5 GB of FREE data per day (Jio Happy New Year Offer 2020).
So I began my research on which lightweight distro to download. I found out about a lot of distros, but I finalized on Vector Linux (based on Slackware).
I don't remember exactly, but there was some issue, and I just couldn't figure out how to install it. But my intuition says that it was an issue with the GNU GRUB boot loader.

<br> <br>
Anyways, my next option was to install Bodhi Linux, which is based on Ubuntu. I still remember the evening I installed it.
I used to fear that if something went wrong, if I messed up the installation, my computer would be cooked, and my parents would scold me.
But that childish curiosity and passion for technology was stronger than my fear. I installed it!

<br> <br>
It took me an entire hour to just run "sudo dpkg -i microsoft-teams-*.deb" after downloading the Debian package.
Also had a roast YouTube channel then, so installed Shotcut video editor, Ocenaudio and GIMP for content creation.

<br> <br>
Since I was a wannabe YouTuber, I was really active on Discord. 
At some point, I got interested in Discord self-bots, and I started making subtle changes 
to self-bot codes written by others on Replit. That's when I discovered Python. 
However, I didn't learn it properly. I was also into grabbing session tokens of Discord
users using some "Mercurial Grabber" and using those tokens to get control of their servers
with thousands of users and selling them for OwO Bot Cowancy or Dank Memer Coins.

<br> <br>
When my 12th was about to end, I got in touch with Devanshu Sharma, 
whom I met through Discord. He's a cybersecurity guy. He wants to be a red teamer.
He convinced me to learn cybersecurity and ethical hacking. 
Bug bounties sounds motivating. So initially I started with the fundamentals of networking 
and programming in C. I was also learning Linux administration at this time. 
I wasn't aware when my interest shifted from cybersecurity to backend infra and DevOps.
But it was somewhere between July and August 2025, during my informal job at XYZ Software Solutions.

<br> <br>
Right now, I am a freelance Backend and DevOps engineer.
