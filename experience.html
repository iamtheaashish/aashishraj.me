I can't really tell you the company name; it was an informal job. 
I received a salary of 15k rupees, out of which I had to pay 5k to the person (let's call him FOO - DevOps Guy) who got me the job.
He taught me some really important stuff. I learned about office politics. 
When Foo switched his job, I was left alone. A senior guy who used to envy FOO, grilled me for BS reasons (because I got in because of FOO). It was becoming toxic, so I quit.
My parents said "Dhang se padhle pehle, krlio job baadme". I didn't even get LOR. ;(
